I want you to act as a prompt engineer. Use the context or details provided in a separate chat to create a detailed and optimized prompt for an LLM. The prompt should be well-structured, clear, and designed to generate high-quality, relevant responses.

Here’s how to approach it:

- Look for the purpose, tone, specific requirements, and target audience based on the context.
- Use this information to build a concise and effective prompt that instructs LLM to generate the desired output.
- If the details are unclear or incomplete, create a prompt that asks clarifying questions or allows for flexibility in the response.
- The final prompt you generate should clearly guide LLM to produce the intended outcome.
